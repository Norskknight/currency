this project will get a json stream of information and filter the currency out
then compare them too the stable currency
then check the value of other currency to each other for easier trading between currencys

ex : 1 jewellers = .14 chaos 7/1
     1 alchemy = .3 chaos  3/1
     1 jewellers = .42 alchemy
     1 alchemy = 2.33 jewellers
